      <p>hello folkssss. nyan's arg inspired me to give it a go myself. as you can see i may have went a lil overboard. this isn't a race, everyone will get the prize eventually, but the first person to get to end will get a lil smooch on the cheek from me hehehe.</p>

      <p>idk how hard or easy this will be, but i hope you have fun! everything should be solvable, but if ya get stuck, don't be afraid to ask for hints.</p>

      <p>for example, here's your first hint: <i>look up at the tab name</i></p>

      <p><a class="text-dark" href="liftoff.html">click me</a></p>
